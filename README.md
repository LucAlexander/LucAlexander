``` ^  ^


I write my own software development frameworks and libraries in pure C.

```

Check out [Neuromorph](https://github.com/LucAleander/Neuromorph):
my tokenizable neural network framework built to allow neural architecture search systems to easily generate diverse model architectures through token sequence generation of a custom description language.


or [Ξ](https://github.com/LucAlexander/Xi):
a highly cache efficient generalized software development framework with compilation targets suitable for Linux, Windows and even Web Assembly.
    * [Locality](https://github.com/LucAlexander/Locality) is its direct predecessor, with a different internal architecture.
    * [xui](https://github.com/LucAlexander/xui) is a minimal gui library built on top of Ξ.
