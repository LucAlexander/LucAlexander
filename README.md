```

## 2025

[Lambda calculus interpreter](https://github.com/LucAlexander/lambda_calc): Parser-less lambda calculus interpreter written in an afternoon as an exercise.

[prototext](https://github.com/LucAlexander/prototext): A prototype forth-like language which mimics natural language, compiles to C.

[Minimal media runtime](https://github.com/LucAlexander/medialayer): A tiny runtime for SDL2 with project support. Demo game available in repo.

## 2024
[protosrc](https://github.com/LucAlexander/protosrc): A prototype programmable programming language, compiles to a 64bit interpreted intermediate representation.

[Compiler Project](https://github.com/LucAlexander/compiler_project): An Unnamed high level compiler frontend and (most) of a backend. Needs a code generation pass still.

[8Bit VM](https://github.com/LucAlexander/vm_tbd): An unnamed simple 8 bit virtual machine made as a learning exercise.

## 2023
[Neuromorph](https://github.com/LucAlexander/NeuroMorph): My capstone project for university, a neural network framework built to allow neural architecture search systems to easily generate diverse model architectures through token sequence generation of a custom embedded model description language.

[xui](https://github.com/LucAlexander/xui): a minimal gui library built for Ξ.

## 2022
[Ξ](https://github.com/LucAlexander/Xi) (Xi): A highly cache efficient generalized software development framework with compilation targets suitable for Linux, Windows and even Web Assembly.

[Locality](https://github.com/LucAlexander/Locality) prototype predecessor to Xi, built with a different architecture.
